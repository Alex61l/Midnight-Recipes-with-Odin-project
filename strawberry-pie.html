<p>Once you've finished kneading the strawberries, add the sugar, a slice of lemon ,and to help thicken the filling, 
make a mixture of cornstarch with a little water and add it to the filling. </li></p>

<p><li>After finishing the filling, place the dough on a table with plastic wrap or a countertop to roll out the dough,
    divide the dough in half into a larger and a larger part, open the larger part and place it at the bottom of the pan, 
    using a fork to do so.</p>
    <p>Make holes in the bottom of the dough to avoid creating bubbles and place the dough to preheat for 10 minutes. After preheating the dough,
     remove it from the oven and add the filling to the pan.
     Open the smaller part of the dough and leave it in the shape of the mold, place this dough on top of the filling and bake at 180Â°
      degrees for 30 minutes.</p>
